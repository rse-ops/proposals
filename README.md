### Usage

#### How do I add a new proposal?

To submit a proposal, you will open a pull request to the repository. 

1. The markdown file should be added under [docs/_proposals/drafts](https://github.com/rse-ops/proposals/tree/main/docs/_proposals/drafts)
2. The name of the file should correspond to the title, e.g., "Automated Container Builds" should be `proposals/drafts/automated-container-builds.md`. Only lowercase letters, numbers, and `-` are allowed in the name.

Once you've prepared the markdown file, open a pull request to the repository.

You aren't allowed to open pull requests to edit more than one proposal at a time.

#### How do I update an existing proposal?
